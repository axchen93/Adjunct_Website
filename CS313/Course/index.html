                <h2>Addendum from the Department Chair</h2>
                F (Failing) is assigned for work that, in the judgment
                of the instructor, does not deserve college credit. WU
                (Withdrawn Unofficially) is assigned by the instructor to
                indicate that the student stopped attending the course
                before the end of the semester; or as a result of excessive
                absences there is no basis to give a final letter grade of
                A+ to F, and the conditions for a grade of INC do not
                apply. Therefore, a student who attended classes and
                showed up for exams is to be evaluated based on his/her
                work, and gets a grade of A+ to F, not WU. On the other
                hand, a student who stopped attending classes at some
                point and skipped the final exam without any attempt to
                communicate with the instructor should get WU, not F
                (certainly not D or better). Any request from a student
                who disappeared from your class to change his/her WU
                to F should be rejected.
                Since attendance is not part of my grading policy, Students who attend both the midterm and the final will
                be awarded a letter grade A+ to F.
                <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
                Any form of plagiarism both copying from others or allowing others to copy is a serious academic infraction. If any student is caught copying, they will be reported to both the chair and the dean. Any projects that are plagiarized will recieve an 0 and reported. Any student caught cheating on an exam, will recieve an 0 on said exam and reported. 
                <h2>Collaboration Policy:</h2>
                <p>
                        Students are encouraged to discuss concepts and share ideas. These discussions must be kept at a general level,
                        without exposing your solutions. Please acknowledge these collaborations in your submission emails.
                        <br>
                        All submitted code must be written by yourself.
                        Students are only allowed to copy code that was supplied by instructors, lectures, or texts. In these cases,
                        students should cite their sources unless it was directly supplied by the instructor.
                        <br>Sharing of code with other students is strictly prohibited.
                        <br>By taking this class you are pledging to not share your solution with your classmates or any future student.
                        Students may not post solutions for any assignments to publicly accessible website. This includes public
                        repositories on GitHub and other version control software.
                        <br>Protect your code, the college does not distinguish between sharer and receiver. If your solution is submitted by
                        another student, both students face the same penalty
