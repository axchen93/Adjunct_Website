	/*Similar to 1D Queens, use a loop to check the array.

	  First condition checks is the same women is married to two different man *hint we need to check if two things are equal*
	  Second condition checks if (Man#i) and (Man#c's wife) both like each other more than their own spouse
	  Third condition checks if (Man#c) and (Man#i's wife) both like each other more than their own spouse

	  mp[i][j] tells you how much Man#i likes Woman#j. (0 = favorite; 2 = least favorite) 
	  wp[i][j] tells you how much Woman#i likes Man#j.

	  mp[i][q[i]] tells you how much Man#i likes his own wife. 
	  mp[i][q[c]] tells you how much Man#i likes Man#c's wife. 
	  wp[q[i]][i] tells you how much Man#i's wife likes Man#i. 
	  wp[q[i]][c] tells you how much Man#i's wife likes Man#c. 
	  If mp[i][q[c]] < mp[i][q[i]], it means that Man#i likes Man#c's wife more than his own wife
